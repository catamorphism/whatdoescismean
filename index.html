<body>

<p>A "cis" person is a person who was assigned a gender and sex at birth that accurately reflect who they are.
A cis woman is a woman who was assigned female at birth and is comfortable being described as female and/or as a woman.
Likewise, a cis man is a man who was assigned male at birth and is comfortable being described as male and/or as a man.

<p>"Cis" can be short for "cissexual" or for "cisgender".
"Cissexual" and "cisgender" sometimes mean different things, but there is no single, agreed-upon definition for either word.
Likewise, there's no single, agreed-upon definition for the words "transsexual" and "transgender".

<p>In Latin, the prefix "cis" means "on the same side" and "trans" means "on the other side".
So, a cis person is one whose assigned sex at birth is on the same side as the sex they are.
Likewise, a trans person is one whose assigned sex at birth is on a different side from the sex they are.
